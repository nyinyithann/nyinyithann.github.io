Hi,

My name is Nyi Nyi Than. I am a father, husband and software developer.
These days I mostly work on .NET platform using C#, F#. Before .NET, I worked for a couple of years in C++/MFC, VB 5/6, and Java.

I am interested in programming languages, and love to craft software products too.
I am currently spending my time learning Rust, Haskell, Swift, OCaml and Modern C++ too.

I find programming in Rust is such a huge fun that i am hoping to go full-time in it.

If you have some interesting opportunity for me, you could direct message me at twitter [@thannyinyi](https://twitter.com/thannyinyi) or send me an email at [nyinyithann@gmail.com](mailto:nyinyithann@gmail.com).
